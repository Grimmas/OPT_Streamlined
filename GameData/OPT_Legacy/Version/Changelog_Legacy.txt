OPT Legacy Spaceplane Parts

2.1 (WIP)

* Added tags to Avatar Shuttle Cockpit. It was not appearing under CCK.
* Added Avatar: inline SAS/RCS; short hollow fuselage; short tank.
* Added Stail: inline SAS/RCS; short tank.
* Added missing SAS module to K Drone Core.
* Fixed CoL in Winglet Type D.
* Fixed texture and material problems in Legacy Wings II.
* Fixed DepthMask meshes' default material when Restock not installed.
* Raised crew capacity from 4 to 6 in K cabin and lab.


2.0

* Added 'brake' tag to airbrake parts. They were not search-able.
* Added K Drone Core with RCS.
  * Added RCS thrusters to K, KH Inline SAS parts.
* Added K crew compartment and science lab.
* Added new suites of parts:
  * 16 VTOL engines. Compatible with WBI Kerbal Actuators and are feature-rich.
  * 2x "Questor" series main wings (types D, E).
  * 2x Stabilizers (canards, type C, D).
  * 4x "Fighter" series winglets (types D, E, F, G) (and associated elevons).
* Moved ARI-73 engine from Aerospace Tech to Nuclear Propulsion tech node. (Advanced Nuclear Propulsion if CTT installed. The LPR-02 "Irradiance" VTOL engine is there with it.)
* Normalized and lowered EC demands in cockpit RCS thrusters.
* Rebalanced engines:
  * Made ARI-73 and air-breathing engines stronger (or appropriately strong) in thicker atmospheres.
  * Made J-81 closed cycle very EC demanding.
  * Nerfed J-60D closed cycle Isp.
  * Normalized EC ratios and Isp of LFO+EC engines.
  * Other air-breathing performance changes.
* Removed single quotes and "class" from part titles.
* Misc part stats adjustments.
* Updated OPT flag.
* Updated DepthMask meshes to always be transparent. (Hopefully makes them friendly or unobtrusive in KSP 1.7 and older.)
* Updated radiator potential on Nebula Shock Intake.
* Updated drop tank heat tolerance selection to not use tank-bearing B9 options when MFT or RF are present.


1.6.2

* Tuned drag cubes for OPT K inline SAS and Humpback family.


1.6.1

* Removed NF Propulsion integration from WarpJet SAGE. There are a few reasons why it cannot happen with this engine as-is.


1.6.0

* Aligned inner stack nodes perfectly with outer nodes for Stail drop bay. Reduces chances of attaching this part wrong and causing insane drag.
* Clean up resource configs in part configs.
* Fixed error in heat limit buff for Stail aerospike.
* Removed SAS module from anything that's not a drone core.
* Updated WarpJet SAGE Engine:
  * Dual-mode.
  * Has VASIMR-like feature powered by B9 Part Switch or Near Future Propulsion. B9-based Isp options require tech node unlock and require the engine to be shutdown while changing option.
* Updated drop tanks:
  * Fixed CoM position. It was at the attach point. It is now properly centered in the tank.
  * Added thermal stats upgrades with texture options.


1.5.0

* All legacy engines: New plumes. New sounds.
* Added Restock DepthMask module to the following. This allows for parts to clip properly into each other and be less likely to show through where they should not:
  * All cockpits with built-in intakes.
  * Mk2 and 2.5m (J92) intakes.
  * All engines.
* Added missing lift surface ratings to these engines: All Mk2, Stail linear aerospike, J-81.
* Added re-entry grade airbrakes (cloned from B9 Aerospace). 
* Added J cabin IVA to Humpback cabin.
* Adjusted engine performance for:
  * J-81: Air-breathing performance buffed for thicker Oxygenated atmospheres.
  * J-60D: ClosedCycle in thicker atmospheres. Might not be notice-able.
* Fixed missing default light action group in legacy J cockpit.
* Fixed low heat tolerance in J-60, J-60D engines. Were 2000K, now 2400 ~ 2700K.
* Fixed (Bandaged) intake module problem in Humpback cockpit. It's now actually useable and equivalent to 2x OPT Mk2 intake.
* Made the ARI-73 much more expensive with reference to its nuclear engine nature and unique advantages.
* Moved RCS plume assets to OPT_Reconfig.
* Removed many old configs.
* Some adjustments to costs and performance of engines.


1.4.2

* Updated WarpJet engines. For real.


1.4.1

* Ensured OPT Mk2 intake always has normalized heat tolerance.
* Updated WarpJet engines to now default to IntakeAir if CRP not installed.
* Fixed drag cubes for Stail and Stail Freight parts.


1.4.0

* Minor engine tuning. ARI engines assume they're in vacuum at 0.1% or 0.001 atm.
* Fixed parts having obsolete category "Propulsion" to "FuelTank".
* Fixed drag cubes in Avatar hollow parts. This made payload-bearing planes un-playable.
* Fixed drag cubes for Humpback hollow parts.
* Changed J-61 engine plume. It breaks in DirectX 11.
* Fixed parts having invalid `dragModelType = override` setting. This causes horrific drag effects.
* Changed the internal names of Avatar parts (formerly "Chimera") that had a "C" designation to "A" to be inline with all other Avatar parts. The Chimera instances are soft-deprecated to not break craft files.
* Legacy wings: removed lift surface module (again); raised actuator speed.
* Applied IVAs (either stock placeholder or closely-matching OPT IVA):
  * Avatar Chimera cockpit
  * K Oulette and K TAV cockpit
* Adjusted and normalized heat tolerances. Many in the Avatar and Stail family had > 3000K. Some other parts (mainly some cockpits) had only 1500K.
* Resurrected Avatar Shuttle/Freight cockpit.
* Updated CCK config to exclude non-OPT parts like Breaking Ground's helic__opt__er blades.


1.3.1

* Prune the lurking Firespitter modules from part configs.
* Reduce cooling requirements in Power Spheres and replace degeneration mechanism's converter module with RTG module. The always-on converter, though it should not use core heat, was somehow a magnet for the timewarp heat bug.
* Nerfed tankage in all inline RCS and aerodynamic RCS clusters. They were quite excessive.
* All RCS performance balanced and now use Plume Party "Soyuz" RCS FX.


1.3.0.2

* Restored unused textures. Shame on me.
* Adjusted versioning URLs.


1.3.0.1

* Adusted radiators.


1.3.0

* Added missing "OPT" prefix to Mk3 part titles.
* Added OPT Nebula Shock intake. It features shock cone animations which require B9 Animation Modules plugin found in B9 Aerospace.
* Added OPT power spheres (super fuel cell and fusion reactors). These will also hold and depend on Dark Goo unless you delete the DarkDrive config.
* Fixed ARI-73 non-spool mode in vacuum.
* Adjusted legacy wings CoL and CoM.
* Deleted unused texture folders, reduced download size by 20 MB.


1.2.5

* Reassessed some bulkhead profiles:
  * updated avatar and chimera
* Fixed missing bulkhead profiles
* Added non-spool secondary mode to ARI-73 engine (for vacuum friendly operation)
* Moved Stail lab to unlock alongside the J lab


1.2

* Anti-collision for Modular Fuel Tanks.
* Fixed Avatar and Humpback aero shielding (except when ramps are attached).
* Aero shielding for things clippd far enough into the Avatar-Chimera cockpit adapter.
* Added inner nodes to Stail Docking & Utility Bay. (Aero shielding always active in it.)
* Added joint strength to Humpback parts.

1.1.3

* Moved CoL, CoP and CoM (centers of lift, pressure (drag) and mass) in Legacy wings so they make more sense (or stop making less sense) in aircraft designs. This should fix a good deal more aero problems.

1.1.2

* Added/fixed science container and Crew Report experiment to Humpback cabin and Stail cockpit
* Moved J-60 and J-61 to Aerospace Tech/ Exp Aircraft Engines in tech trees

1.1.1

1.1.0

* Added dependency/migrated most MM patches to --> OPT Reconfig mod

  * CCK support (OPT category will show if OPT Legacy without OPT Main is installed)
  * Manufacturer in blade antenna and some tanks
  * bulkhead profile in J-81 engine, spotted by Kolago
  * Stail lab science cap, is 1050 now, not 500
* Added Tweakscale for all the surface-attached RCS
* Replaced FS dependency in Stail docking and utility bay with stock module
* Configured engines:
  * Retuned WarpJets and fixed Isp problem. SAGE is a little stronger now and will flameout at 9 atm, not 3 atm
  * Adjusted particles for all engines (again =D )
  * Use cases
    * J-61 is no longer as wasteful or wildly OP but is a dynamic scramjet now (endless acceleration with Isp falloff)
    * J-60 is also a dynamic scramjet (endless acceleration with Isp falloff)
    * J-60D requires EC in ClosedCycle, Isp lowered so the J-81 stands alone as highest Isp vac engine (like Dark Drive) but J-60D in closed cycle remains very powerful near sea-level in atmo unlike J-81
    * J-81 requires EC in ClosedCycle and is poor near sea level, gets a boost at 0.3 atm pressure
	* J-81 airbreathing mode adjusted for thick atmosphere
    * Stail Linear Aerospike has better thrust and Isp
  * Gimbals
    * J-81 visibly animates: given plenty Yaw authority and slight Pitch authority due to dual nozzle (emulate differential thrust)
    * J-60 and J-60D same as J-81 but do not animate
    * WarpJet SURGE given half gimbal ranges of J-60, J-60D
    * Stail Linear Aerospike does not animate but is given plenty Pitch authority

1.0.9

* Added inner attachment nodes for Humpback hollow fuselage
* Adjustment to ARI-73 and WarpJet engines (In particular, the ARI no longer grants insane dV)
* Fixed Tweakscale and RemoteTech patches
* Fixed cargo bay modules, removed aeroshield patch: the problem of reversed cargo module status
* Further bulk update to all cargo bays and hollow fuselages: add/fix attach nodes, cargo modules, categories
