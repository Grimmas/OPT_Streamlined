		change = * Adjusted J-60 stationary thrust to match.
		change = Changed J-81 engine behavior to be as advanced NTR/NTJ.
		change = Decreased RCS thrust in Rudder engine.
		change = Fixed broken heat limit key in Stail bicoupler. (Spotted by @ Lisias.)

		change = Removed extra lift module from K lab.
		change = Updated DepthMask patch to detect standalone DepthMask plugin.
		change = Updated offset between inner and outer stack nodes of Avatar and Humpback bays to make it less likely to attach them the wrong way and break cargo shielding.
