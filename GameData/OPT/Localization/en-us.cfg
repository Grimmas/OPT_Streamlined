		#LOC_OPT_AAengine_desc = The ARI Engine is a unique, small profile engine. It uses OPT's S.C.O.O.P. technology to achieve high efficiency within the Atmosphere. At the same time it act as a normal chemical propulsion engine in space.
		#LOC_OPT_engine_darkDrive_desc = After decades of top secret research on the Mystery Goo, kerbal scientists finally discovered, or produced, what was fittingly called the Dark Goo. Following this breakthrough, they have only begun to find its uses in containment, catalyst processes and combustion, and with those, the ability to produce a curious new breed of ultimate engine, the Dark Drive.
		#LOC_OPT_j_linear_aerospike_desc = This linear aerospike engine is fitted for the J fuselage. It certainly packs a punch for its size.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_mk2_engine_short_desc = A mysterious atmospheric engine that offers great thrust at thin atmosphere.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_nebula_engine_desc = The nebula engine is the ultimate engine to achieve SSTO. It's a shcram jet equipped with a massive Super Condensation Optimized Output Propulsion unit. It scoops up various inert gases in the atmosphere. Once optimum speed and altitude is reached, the engine ionize and super heat the gases in its chamber, the resulting plasma is then expelled together with the hot gas from the shcram jet. The result is a brilliant blue plasma 'after burner', which will give any spaceplane a powerful punch into space.
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_jumpa1_desc = OPT's engineers became aware in the mid-late phase of their hover drive concept program, that there were too few engines that could freely swap between vertical and forward operations modes. Especially large planes like the K class are the target for this model but it wont be hard to build smaller...
		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_jumpa2_desc = It goes without saying that a WarpJet form of the K Tilt Engine needed to exist. And so came the M.A.R.G.E. (Modular Axis Respirating Gauss Engine).

		#LOC_OPT_opt_vtol_wrapj1_desc = This powerful accessory, the Fuselage Vertical Thruster hooks on at the sides of the fuselage and includes working intake and exhaust shutters to protect its innards from the fires of reentry. Be careful not to fire this engine while the exhaust shutter is closed!

		#LOC_OPT_opt_s2intake_desc = Designing an air-breathing engine tends to be easy. Designing the ultimate among them was rather hard... But designing the nacelle fit for that engine, the J-92 Shcramjet, had OPT's brightest minds simply beat their heads against their desks. This was until someone discovered a way to compartmentalize the internals properly...after randomly cramming things into their drawer and later finding that everything somehow sorted themselves nicely.

Their rebellion was fortnately not enough to get them sacked or worse.
