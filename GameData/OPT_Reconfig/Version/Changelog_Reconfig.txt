OPT Reconfig


3.4.1

* Fixed lingering OPT SAS problem(s).
* Fixed excessive EC demand of 2.5m Dark Energy power sphere's Dark Goo regeneration.
* Increased drag power of OPT airbrakes.


3.4

* Changed life support resources into a discrete B9 switch module on crewed parts.
* Fixed issue with missing keys on EggDog engines when CryoEngines installed.
* Fixed missing Oxidizer gauge on EggDog and Bubble engines.
* Fixed other issues with WBI Classic Stock and CryoEngines:
  * Default tank amounts were wrong.
  * Made OmniStorage default to LiquidFuel, not Propellium, when OPT_Reconfig_CryoEngines not active.
  * Made air-breathing fuel mix switcher (in engines) default to LiquidFuel, not Propellium, when OPT_Reconfig_CryoEngines not active.
* WBI Stress!
  * Allowed entertainment center to not need a connection to the homeworld.
  * Discounted microgravity stress except when Less or Zero Handwavium active.


3.3

* Adjusted Dark Drive options to detect "SystemHeatConverters" to hopefully cure System Heat conflict.
* Created Extras folder containing:
  * OPT_Reconfig_CryoEngines.cfg - Except for RO users, this has been moved out and is now completely optional.
  * OPT_Reconfig_LessHandwavium.cfg - Changes engine behaviors and Tidal Force power spheres to be more "stockalike" or "realistic."
  * OPT_Reconfig_ZeroHandwavium.cfg - Includes the former and deletes the "Dark Energy" power spheres and end-game engines.
  * OPT_Reconfig_LessB9ForTweakScale.cfg - Disables B9 toggles for engines and converters as TweakScale doesn't handle them well.
* Fixed OPTSAS problem.


3.2

* Added Feature Bias "B" tweakable. Edit the values in `OPT_Reconfig/OPT_00Tweak.cfg` to your liking. Not tested for use with RealismOverhaul but should still work just fine. This tweakable allows for:
  * [1] Reducing the handwavium nature of most OPT engines and the "Tidal Force" (fuel cell) power spheres: give them stockalike or more realistic:tm: behavior.
  * [2] Option [1] + Deleting the Dark Drive, WarpJets, Bubble engine, and "Dark Energy" (fusion) power spheres.

* Fixed redundant FFT Antimatter containment module on parts.
* Fixed other fatal Classic Stock issues.
* Improved or fixed integration with Classic Stock and Rational Resources.

  * Enabled OPT bodies to hold FFT propellants including Antimatter and to carry the containment module.
* Fixed RO antenna patch to detect RealAntennas and not RO.
* Revised "Dark Energy" power sphere fuel options.
* Revised Dark Goo system:
  * "Dark Energy" power spheres hold this by default and not XenonGas.
  * Dark Goo is its own fusion fuel option and no longer a component of all other fusion fuel options.
  * Phased out Dark Science.
* Tiny fixes.

* Buffed most tank volumes (as measured with stock fuel tanks and WBI Mule MLM. They now largely hold 2x the usual amounts and have comparable dry/wet ratios to stock tanks. This will upset, though not break, many craft). OPT is also now much more usable with Nertea's CryoTanks and CryoEngines.
* Cockpits now hold much less fuel. They were excessive.
* All RCS performance balanced and now use Plume Party "Soyuz" RCS FX.
