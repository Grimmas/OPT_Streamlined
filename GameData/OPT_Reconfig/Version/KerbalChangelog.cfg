	modName = OPT Reconfig
	
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.3.0
		change = Added heat limit upgrades for H noses. (Bundled with Mk2 nose upgrades.)
		change = Fixes to IntakeAtm and CryoEngines patches.
		change = Removed GPOSpeed fuel patch. Unknown if it suports Omnistorage.
		change = Rewrote WBI integration and phased out Pathfinder legacy templates. It's all OmniConverters and OmniStorage. Always has been.
		change = OPT in ClassicStock play mode uses "PropLox" fuel mix (Propellium + Oxidizer, equivalent to Hydrolox).
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.2.0
		change = Added KerbalChangelog support.
		change = Fixed OPTLH2O tank problem. (I hope)
		change = Updated FAR config:
		change = * Added all Legacy wings.
		change = * Added missing references to rotation transforms for Main's wings.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.1.0
		change = Absorbed and unified configs and other resources from OPT Main (now Continued).
		change = * Agencies with updated logos.
		change = * Flags. New and replaced ones.
		change = Added colors to B9 tank options for NF Propulsion.
		change = Added Water to Rational Resources B9 tank options.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.7
		change = Finally understood and fixed the KerbalAtomics/OPTLH2O problem.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.6
		change = Added stack nodes to KH fuselage for mounting payloads without causing CoM offset.
		change = * Added B9 switcher for these stack nodes and for KH inline SAS and cargo tails.
		change = Changed Covert Aeronautics tech nodes to hide if empty (when obscure tech trees are installed and if they move OPT end-game parts).
		change = Fixed B9PS RCS options to properly need or not need CRP where appropriate.
		change = Fixed missing Dark Science in K lab.
		change = Some housekeeping.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.5
		change = Added CryoEngines support for VTOL engines.
		change = Fixed missing support for Connected Living Spaces.
		change = Fixed low or imbalanced heat limits in Mk2 ram intake.
		change = Fixed WarpJet VTOL engines not using IntakeAtm when CRP is present.
		change = Fixed wings not getting WBI tanks.
		change = Raised K crew capacities to 6.
		change = Updated KIS compatibility.
		change = * KIS feature no longer needs WBI Pathfinder installed but still work well with it.
		change = * H body and most? of K body get KIS space. Space is reduced when Pathfinder not installed as to not overlap a lot with fuel space.
		change = Updated heat limit upgrades.
		change = * Fixed minor issues or shortcomings.
		change = * Fixed Stail Drone core not losing Ablator tank type when MFT/RF installed.
		change = * Split Mk2 heat upgrade into 2 upgrades.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.4
		change = Fixed undefined value problem with Power Spheres for WBI integration.
		change = Updated WarpJet (air-breathing) rescale patch to include WarpJet VTOl engines.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.3
		change = Fixed Configurable Containers detection.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.2
		change = Added missing turbine fuel mix options. The following VTOL engines can switch (in air-breathing mode) between LiquidFuel + IntakeAir and LFO + IntakeAtm.
		change = * Helicarrier, Bubble, Valkyrie.
		change = Finally fixed default for Power Sphere VS-01 "Tidal Force": defaults to LFO and not Methalox.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0.1
		change = Added missing SAS module to K drone core.
		change = Fixed Hydrolox tank issue.
	}
	VERSION
	{
		Version 2.0
		change = Added drag cube fix for stock Mk2 drone core.
		change = Added drag cube fix for H bodies.
		change = Added lift surface and 2nd RCS module (seet to use throttle) to aerodynamic OMS thruster. You may need to replace this part on very craft that has it so that it behaves properly.
		change = Added (Upgraded) support for Allista's Configurable Containers.
		change = Added Kerbalism buffs for science data and samples storage.
		change = Added Covert Aero II tech node for even more advanced OPT engines.
		change = * Moved Dark Drive and its new friend, the Bubble, into there.
		change = Added tank options for Stail Drone Core and Stail Fairing MonoPropellant Tank.
		change = Added/updated subcategory icons.
		change = Added thermal upgrades for J nose, Stail Drone Core, Mk2 nose.
		change = * Made upgrade nodes themselves more informative in RnD view.
		change = Added a tech node after Covert Aeronautics. Compatible with CTT and Unkerballed Start.
		change = Deprecated redundant RCS parts. The remaining parts now include all RCS mix options and color change where applicable. (Soft-deprecation. Craft files will not break.)
		change = Fixed Kerbalism detection, NF Propulsion detection and erroneous Xenon tank type settings.
		change = Fixed erroneous static thrust problem on HAE-02 and J-92 Nebula jet engines.
		change = Moved J linear aerospike and HAE-02 jet engine to Hypersonic Flight tech node alongside the Stail linear aerospike.
		change = Reduced EC demand in all MonoPropellant RCS.
		change = Several tiny tweaks.
		change = Updated Dark Goo:
		change = * Boiloff rate is 0.2x as fast as before.
		change = * Dark Drive now holds 3x as much. Its mileage should be quite great now.
